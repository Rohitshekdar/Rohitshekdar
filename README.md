# Enhanced Speaker Recognition Using DSP in MATLAB  

## Overview  
This repository contains an **Enhanced Speaker Recognition System** implemented using **Digital Signal Processing (DSP)** techniques in MATLAB. The system leverages advanced signal analysis and machine learning methods to identify and verify speakers based on their unique vocal characteristics.  

## Features  
- **Preprocessing:**  
  - Noise reduction  
  - Silence removal  
  - Signal normalization  

- **Feature Extraction:**  
  - **Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs):** Capture spectral properties.  
  - **Linear Predictive Coding (LPC):** Model vocal tract features.  
  - **Spectral Analysis:** Extract robust frequency-domain features.  

- **Classification & Matching:**  
  - **Dynamic Time Warping (DTW):** Measure signal similarity.  
  - **Vector Quantization (VQ):** Cluster and classify voice features.  
  - **Machine Learning Algorithms:** Employ SVM, KNN, or similar methods for enhanced accuracy.  

## Workflow  
1. **Voice Signal Acquisition:** Input audio is collected via a microphone.  
2. **Signal Preprocessing:** Filter and normalize the audio for analysis.  
3. **Feature Extraction:** Analyze the audio to extract unique speaker features.  
4. **Speaker Modeling:** Build models for each speaker using extracted features.  
5. **Recognition/Verification:** Compare input voice samples with stored models for identification or authentication.  

## Applications  
- **Biometric Authentication:** Voice-based secure logins for devices.  
- **Access Control:** Voice-activated entry systems.  
- **Customer Support:** Personalized responses based on speaker identity.  
- **Assistive Technologies:** Voice-controlled systems for accessibility.  

## Requirements  
- MATLAB (with DSP Toolbox)  
- Audio recording device (e.g., microphone)  
- Sample audio dataset for training and testing
